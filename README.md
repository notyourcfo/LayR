LayR is a free and open-source tool for creating text-behind-image designs, with additional editing features.
This project is a modified fork of Text Behind Image

Features

Compared to the original project, this fork adds:

Layer sorting → bring text forward or send it behind objects.

Width & height scaling → compress or stretch text at different angles.

Blend modes → experiment with overlays & creative effects.

3D text effects (previously paywalled in other tools).

Basic image adjustments → brightness, contrast, rotation, aspect ratio.

Sleek, improved UI with smoother workflow.
